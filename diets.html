                    <p class="text-diets">WW, formerly Weight Watchers, is one of the most popular weight loss programs worldwide.<br><br> While it doesn’t restrict any food groups, people on a WW plan must eat within their set daily points to reach their ideal weight.<br><br>
                        <strong>How it works:</strong> WW is a points-based system that assigns different foods and beverages a value, depending on their calorie, fat, and fiber contents.<br><br> To reach your desired weight, you must stay within your daily
                        point allowance.<br><br>
                        <strong>Weight loss:</strong> Many studies show that the WW program can help you lose weight.<br><br> For example, a review of 45 studies found that people who followed a WW diet lost 2.6% more weight than people who received standard
                        counseling.
                        <br><br> What’s more, people who follow WW programs have been shown to be more successful at maintaining weight loss after several years, compared with those who follow other diets.<br><br>
                        <strong>Other benefits:</strong> WW allows flexibility, making it easy to follow. This enables people with dietary restrictions, such as those with food allergies, to adhere to the plan.<br><br>
                        <strong>Downsides:</strong> While it allows for flexibility, WW can be costly depending on the subscription plan. Also, it’s flexibility can be a downfall if dieters choose unhealthy foods.

                    <p class="text-diets">Plant-based diets may help you lose weight. Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular versions, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons.<br><br>
                        <strong>How it works:</strong> There are many types of vegetarianism, but most involve eliminating all meat, poultry, and fish. Some vegetarians may likewise avoid eggs and dairy.<br><br> The vegan diet takes it a step further by restricting
                        all animal products, as well as animal-derived products like dairy, gelatin, honey, whey, casein, and albumin.<br><br> There are no clear-cut rules for the flexitarian diet, as it’s a lifestyle change rather than a diet. It encourages
                        eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains but allows for protein and animal products in moderation, making it a popular alternative.<br><br>
                        <strong>Weight loss:</strong> Research shows that plant-based diets are effective for weight loss.<br><br> A review of 12 studies including 1,151 participants found that people on a plant-based diet lost an average of 2 kg more than
                        those who included animal products.<br><br> Plus, those following a vegan diet lost an average of 2.5 kg more than people not eating a plant-based diet.<br><br> Plant-based diets likely aid weight loss because they tend to be rich
                        in fiber, which can help you stay fuller for longer, and low in high-calorie fat.<br><br>

                        <strong>Other benefits:</strong> Plant-based diets have been linked to many other benefits, such as a reduced risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, certain cancers, and diabetes. They can also be more environmentally sustainable
                        than meat-based diets.<br><br>
                        <strong>Downsides: </strong>Though plant-based diets are healthy, they can restrict important nutrients that are typically found in animal products, such as iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids.

                    <p class="text-diets">Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.<br><br>
                        <strong>How it works:</strong>Intermittent fasting restricts the time you’re allowed to eat, which is a simple way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss — unless you compensate by eating too much food during allowed
                        eating periods.<br><br>
                        <strong>Weight loss:</strong> In a review of studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 3–8% weight loss over 3–24 weeks, which is a significantly greater percentage than other methods.<br><br> The same review showed that this
                        way of eating may reduce waist circumference by 4–7%, which is a marker for harmful belly fat.<br><br> Other studies found that intermittent fasting can increase fat burning while preserving muscle mass, which can improve metabolism.<br><br>
                        <strong>Other benefits:</strong> Intermittent fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased insulin sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many other benefits.<br><br>
                        <strong>Downsides:</strong> In general, intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults.

                    <p class="text-diets">The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece used to eat.<br><br> Though it was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that it can also aid weight loss.<br><br>
                        <strong>How it works:</strong> The Mediterranean diet advocates eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, tubers, whole grains, fish, seafood, and extra virgin olive oil.<br><br> Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy
                        products are to be eaten in moderation. Meanwhile, red meats are limited. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet restricts refined grains, trans fats, refined oils, processed meats, added sugar, and other highly processed foods.
                        <strong>Weight loss:</strong> Though it’s not specifically a weight loss diet, many studies show that adopting a Mediterranean-style diet may aid weight loss.<br><br> For example, an analysis of 19 studies found that people who combined
                        the Mediterranean diet with exercise or calorie restriction lost an average of 4 kg more than those on a control diet.<br><br>
                        <strong>Other benefits:</strong> The Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, which may help combat inflammation and oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals. It has been linked to reduced risks
                        of heart disease and premature death.<br><br>
                        <strong>Downsides:</strong> As the Mediterranean diet is not strictly a weight loss diet, people may not lose weight following it unless they also consume fewer calories.
